My inspiration comes from an experience that my computer broke down and my friend's mobile phone was lost. I know that electronic devices and the Internet play a vital role in human life, but this idea has always been conceptual, and I haven't felt anything wrong, but when my computer broke down again, I had a feeling of "losing contact with the world". I can't do my daily work, I can't easily send e-mail to get in touch with others, and there are fewer ways of entertainment, including online shopping, and there are problems with a series of authentication methods. Until this time, I really found that we live in an Internet world, especially young people. I began to think, is this really the right way?

I feel that although we live in the real world, we are virtually linked by the Internet, and everyone lives in a small grid of this huge network. Each small grid is linked through the network. Maybe we are not in this network all the time, but when key events occur, everyone must be in the specified position in the grid, otherwise your grid can't run. The shape of each person's grid will change, sometimes square, sometimes hexagonal, and sometimes become a narrow rectangle. I think it's very much like people's living conditions. When you entertain through Internet games, you will become very comfortable, which is like a circle; When you have to go through the Internet studio, you are constrained by various conditions, which is like a regular square; When you socialize through the Internet and get in touch with others, it is like a huge honeycomb, which is the hexagon we see.

Although we use the Internet to make life much easier, at the same time, I feel that we are also the enslaved party. I think each of us is like a small grid, lost in the huge network of the Internet. To a certain extent, being separated from the Internet is to be separated from the society, just like grandparents who can't use computers. To tell the truth, to a certain extent, they lack a certain degree of participation in this society. Are we enslaving the Internet or the Internet enslaving us? This is a question worth pondering.

Therefore, I simulated a dynamic maze of the Internet, in which small grids are the current living state of our human society. The shape and color of the small grid will change with the movement of the mouse, which represents people's different living conditions. With the movement of the mouse, the network will fluctuate, but no matter how it fluctuates, these small grids are inseparable from the network system. The huge network is like a maze, and we are the people lost in this huge network.
